<p>
  White Bird Clinic has published a human services resource guide called
  the &quot;Help Book&quot; since the 1980s. It contains a comprehensive
  listing of resources of people seeking health and housing resources,
  financial assistance, shelter, food pantries and meal sites, and help to
  meet other basic needs. It helps people navigate the system.
